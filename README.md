# Money transfer app
This app allows to make fake transfers and requests to people in a fake contact list. As this is a mobile app mock, the UI is optimized for mobile.
This project is meant to show my ability to develop React apps.

A live version can be found [here](http://rbortnikas.surge.sh/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this app, enter `npm install` in your project directory, followed by `npm start`.
Basic tests can be run by entering `npm test`.

##### To do:
* Implement more robust tests.

##### External components used:
* react-modal
